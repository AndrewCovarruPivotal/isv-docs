With this release, we have a handful of changes that require attention from tile authors. PCF 2.4 Breaking Changes \u00b6 Credhub 2.0 \u00b6 Credhub 2.0 has backwards-incompatible API and manifest changes. The biggest changes are: Authorization model changes: Identities will no longer be able to write to CredHub solely by virtue of authenticating. Instead, an explicit access control entry will need to be created, granting an identity read, write, delete, read_acl, and/or write_acl permissions to an identity, for a given namespace. set and generate changes: CredHub is simplifying the rules that determine when set or generate requests will do nothing or overwrite existing values. Minor manifest changes: The structure of our properties hash is changing slightly. Authorization on by default: The default value of credhub.authorization.acls.enabled is changing from false to true. For tiles that are already consuming CredHub 1.9.x, there will not be any breaking changes. If you use CredHub, please perform regression testing with PAS for Credhub 2.0. We can give you access to an environment with an alpha PAS release with the new credhub verison. Customers who do a fresh install of PAS will be impacted, and will need to apply new permissions when bootstrapping. The Credhub 2.0 upgrade does not affect customers who upgrade PAS. Migrate cflinuxfs2 apps over to cflinuxfs3 \u00b6 In PAS 2.4, cflinuxfs3 will be the default stack underneath cf push ed applications. If your tile contains errands that push applications (e.g. Tile Generator app or app-broker packages, other service brokers), you must update to explicitly push apps with cflinuxfs3. Tile Generator updates to enable cflinuxfs3 will come in November. The stack property on apps is sticky, so it will not change automatically unless they are explicitly re-pushed with cflinuxfs3. Canonical will end general support for cflinuxfs2 stack (derived from Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 LTS) on April 18th, 2019. Because of this, we plan to remove cflinuxfs2 in a patch release of PCF 2.4. PCF 2.4 will not support cf-mysql or MySQLv1 \u00b6 PCF 2.4 will not support older versions of MySQL (cf-mysql and MySQL for PCF v1). For existing v1 users, v1 will be supported through October 2018. Xenial Stemcells \u00b6 Canonical will end support for Ubuntu Trusty Tahr on April 30th, 2019 and security fixes will no longer be backported. PCF is transitioning to use stemcells based on Xenial Xerus and will no longer support Trusty stemcells in PCF 2.5. Tile authors should start testing with the Xenial stemcells and fix any compatibility issues. For more information, please see the communication from us on July 19th. Xenial stemcells are now available on Pivotal Network . Consul Removal / BOSH DNS Adoption \u00b6 For tiles that include consul clients: by the time a customer upgrades to PCF 2.4, you must have removed consul clients from your product, because the server will be completely gone and your deployments will fail to deploy. If your product needs to support multiple versions of PCF : you need to conditionally turn consul on/off in the 2.2 version of your product, as the manifest snippet below shows. Then you need to remove consul clients in the 2.3 version of your product, once you can count on BOSH DNS. - name: consul_agent release: consul consumes: | consul_common: {from: consul_common_link, deployment: \"(( ..cf.deployment_name ))\"} consul_client: {from: consul_client_link, deployment: \"(( ..cf.deployment_name ))\"} consul_server: nil manifest: | --- consul: client: enabled: \"(( $ops_manager.dns_enabled ? false : true ))\" Upcoming Deprecations \u00b6 Use UAA Client Credentials Instead of Admin Users \u00b6 The introduction of cf auth --client-credentials allows components using cloud_controller.admin to leverage a client instead of a user. PCF 2.5 will include a set of tile_installer_client credentials to bootstrap client credentials for long-term use, instead of using shared admin-level credentials. The benefits of this include supporting customers who need to use two-factor authentication for users, disabling internal users to meet compliance regulations, and better support for credential rotation. As the details of this develop, we plan to enhance Tile Generator to help make this process smoother. In the meantime, if you would like more information, please reach out to us in Pivotal Partners Slack. PAS Components Moving to BPM \u00b6 Internal PAS components plan to use the BOSH Process Manager (BPM) in PCF 2.5 to keep jobs simpler, boilerplate-free, and isolated from one another so processes cannot leak data to each other. This should be transparent for most partner products, but will change the structure of internal PAS component deployments. Partners may also look to use BPM in their own BOSH releases. PKS 1.3 New Features \u00b6 We are targeting PKS 1.3 for a early January release. Date TBD pending when \u2154 major IaaSs release their K8s 1.12 compatible version. Please see the Aha! For the latest with PKS Kubernetes 1.12 \u00b6 PKS 1.3 will support K8s 1.12. Known changes in K8s 1.12 can be found here: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.12.md Configurable network options for clusters \u00b6 Allows customers to to enable different network configuration for different clusters. With this capability, they can select the appropriate T) the cluster should route Ingress & Egress from. This will help allow increased scale (both at PKS level and at a per cluster level) and network security isolation when multiple tenants use PKS. Azure Support (Beta) \u00b6 PKS 1.3 intends to add Azure support as a beta feature. Note this will not be compatible with NSX-T. This will allow PKS workloads to be deployed on Azure. The Beta designation is because there is a capability we are waiting on Microsoft to enable multiple MSIs, as without this feature there are security concerns deploying Azure on production workloads (non-production should be fine). PCF 2.3 Compatibility Reminder \u00b6 BOSH DNS Adoption (Consul Server Removed) \u00b6 In PCF 2.3, Consul server will be removed and BOSH DNS will be used instead. Tile authors should start the process of removing Consul agents , which needs to be completed by PCF 2.4. Consul will be completely removed by PCF 2.5. Credhub \u00b6 Credhub 2.0 will be available for PCF 2.3 and may affect partner tiles in three areas: Ops Manager will act as the CredHub client, and the tile can continue to use the \\ ((( VARIABLE ))) syntax for templating. This should not affect most tile authors. If your tile includes a service broker that uses the secure credentials workflow , that service broker would act as a CredHub client and will need updating. Likewise, if a tile includes an app that uses this workflow, that app would act as a CredHub client and will need updating. If your tile includes its own CredHub instance, this not affected by this upgrade. Your tile manages is own CredHub version and should be upgraded separately. Upcoming Deprecations \u00b6 MySQLv1 and cf-mysql \u00b6 PCF 2.4 will not support older versions of MySQL (cf-mysql and MySQL for PCF v1). Partner tiles that depend on this service should start migrating to the MySQL for PCF v2 (pivotal-mysql) tile . If your tile uses cf-mysql or p-mysql, you should: Change your tile to use pivotal-mysql Update your tile to declare a dependency on pivotal-mysql, and Document a strategy for data migration. cflinuxfs2 \u00b6 In PAS 2.3, the cflinuxfs3 stack will be available alongside cflinuxfs2. In PCF 2.4, cflinuxfs3 will become the default stack. In PCF 2.5, the cflinuxfs2 stack will no longer be included. There are no plans to make cflinuxfs3 available as a patch release to PAS 2.2. When Ubuntu 14.04 LTS becomes unsupported in April 2019, cflinuxfs2 will be removed from PAS 2.3+ in patch releases. If you are using tile generator, you will need to rebuild your tile for PAS 2.3. If you are not using tile generator and your tile contains errands that push applications (e.g. service brokers), you will need to adjust your errands. Your apps should check the available stacks and use the cflinuxfs3 if it is available, otherwise using cflinuxfs2. This change must be completed by PCF 2.4 when cflinuxfs3 becomes the default stack. If your tile distributed buildpacks using cflinuxfs3, your tile should provide a separate buildpack with the same name for cflinuxfs3. Administrative tasks must use client credentials \u00b6 Components today have errands and other tasks such as smoke tests and deploy scripts that use an internal user to perform administrative operations. These applications should move away from internal users and instead leverage client credentials. This allows for disabling of internal users to meet customer compliance where they must not have service accounts and must use enterprise users (SAML or LDAP). It also facilitates credential rotation and MFA enablement. Service tile authors will need to complete this change by PCF 2.4. Instructions for doing this change will be available after the 2.3 release. PCF 2.2 Compatibility Reminder \u00b6 BOSH DNS Default (Instead of Consul) \u00b6 BOSH DNS will be enabled by default, although Consul will still be available till the PCF 2.3 release (mid-September 2018). PCF 2.1 Compatibility Reminder \u00b6 Removal of IP accessors (.ips, .first_ip) \u00b6 Tiles need to use BOSH links to retrieve IP addresses for other components. Why is this important? \u00b6 Customers want to do more automation using Ops Manager-generated manifests. Today this is difficult because any IP Address Management (IPAM) done by Ops Manager can potentially conflict with changes made through the customer\u2019s own automation. BOSH can now handle all IPAM. Using BOSH links, your software can receive IP addresses assigned by BOSH. What do I need to do? \u00b6 If you use tile-generator to build your tile, update to the latest version and rebuild. If you have BOSH jobs defined in your tile, use dynamic_ips: 1 and static_ips: 0 for each job. This will use BOSH for IPAM instead of Ops Manager. (Note that \u201cdynamic\u201d is a bit overstated; BOSH will keep your job at the same IP address unless that is not possible, e.g., the operator changes the IP address range and that IP address is no longer available.) If a BOSH release in your tile needs the IP address of another component, consume its BOSH link. In particular, IP address accessors like the following will not be available in PCF 2.1 : \\ (( ..othertile.otherjob.first_ip )) (( ..othertile.otherjob.ips )) (( .otherjob.first_ip )) (( .otherjob.ips )) (( first_ip )) (( ips )) If other components need your BOSH job\u2019s IP address, provide a BOSH link. For implementation details, please refer to the with-link examples in our pcf-examples repository and the Tile Generator documentation . For more background and context on BOSH links, see BOSH Links: Why and How and the official BOSH links documentation . Questions? \u00b6 Reach out to us on the Pivotal Partner Slack Team Forward Looking Statement. This contains statements relating to Pivotal\u2019s expectations, projections, beliefs and prospects which are \"forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the federal securities laws and by their nature are uncertain. Words such as \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"expect,\" \"plans,\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

With this release, we have a handful of changes that require attention from tile authors. PCF 2.5 Breaking Changes \u00b6 Minimum supported Stemcells version is Xenial \u00b6 Canonical will end support for Ubuntu Trusty Tahr on April 30th, 2019 and security fixes will no longer be backported. Tile authors should immediately start testing with the Xenial stemcells and fix any compatibility issues. As of February 15th, we will not publish new partner product releases on PivNet, unless they support Xenial stemcells. Starting April 30th, 2019, we will be retiring all partner products that require a Trustry stemcell from PivNet. Xenial stemcells are available on Pivotal Network . See \u201cXenial Stemcells\u201d in the PCF 2.4 Compatibility Reminder section for more details. Apps must use cflinuxfs3 stack \u00b6 In PAS 2.5, cflinuxfs3 will be the only stack underneath cf push ed applications. Use the latest Tile Generator updates to enable cflinuxfs3. See \u201cMigrate cflinuxfs2 apps over to cflinuxfs3\u201d in the PCF 2.4 Compatibility Reminder section for full details on this now breaking change. Ops Manager defaults to Availability Zones in Azure for clean installs \u00b6 We now default to Availability Zones in Azure for clean installs. This will break your CI if you\u2019re not in a region that supports AZs (7 global regions do). You can always go back to avail sets, but we\u2019d prefer you switch regions instead. \\ Ops Manager has renamed its files on PivNet, and is actually using 3-digit version numbers everywhere \u00b6 In order to standardize filenames to the requested scheme from platform automation, OM has renamed all of its files to contain the product slug and a full 3 digit version number like so: \\ OpsManager2.5-build.128onGCP.yml is now ops-manager-gcp-2.5.0-build.128.yml The reported product version in the API/UI will now have 3 digits as well, though alphas/beta/RCs will all be 2.5.0 (with an increasing build number after the patch). New Features in Ops Manager \u00b6 [New Feature] : Tile authors can now implement user-facing warnings that display when a pre-delete or post-deploy errand is implemented. Use the impact_warning key in pre_delete_errands or post_deploy_errands to specify a warning. [New Feature] : You can now change a selected option of a selector with the API using the human-readable name of the option. Send a PUT to /api/v0/staged/products/:GUID/properties with a selected_option key. The PUT API endpoint can also parse both value, for the human-readable value, and option_value, for the machine-readable value. [New Feature] : You can now use ((cpu)) as a double-parens job accessor to interpolate the CPU value in a manifest. [New Feature] : Tile authors can now use a double-parens accessor to pull information from Ops Manager. Use the (($ops_manager.restricted_view_api_access_credentials)) accessor to make read-only, non-credential requests to Ops Manager. [New Feature] : Tile authors can access a catalog of available VM types with the (($ops_manager.instance_types_catalog)) accessor. [New Feature] : You can provide custom rsyslog configurations in the Syslog form. [New Feature] : Tile authors can write and apply JS migrations to migrate data from their existing syslog configurations to Ops Manager\u2019s template syslog form. For more information, see opsmanager_syslog in the Tile Developer docs. Upcoming Deprecations for Future Releases \u00b6 Metron Agent Eventually Going Away \u00b6 The loggregator-agent release is the new drop-in replacement to replace metron. In PAS 2.5, metron agent will disappear and you will have to update your BOSH manifest to use the loggregator-agent release instead. Use UAA Client Credentials Instead of Admin Users \u00b6 The introduction of cf auth --client-credentials allows components using cloud_controller.admin to leverage a client instead of a user. PCF 2.5 will include a set of tile_installer_client credentials to bootstrap client credentials for long-term use, instead of using shared admin-level credentials. In a future version of PCF, you must comply with not using an Admin user. The benefits of this include supporting customers who need to use two-factor authentication for users, disabling internal users to meet compliance regulations, and better support for credential rotation. PAS Components Moving to BPM \u00b6 Internal PAS components are migrating to BOSH Process Manager (BPM) as of PCF 2.5 to keep jobs simpler, boilerplate-free, and isolated from one another so processes cannot leak data to each other. This should be transparent for most partner products, but will change the structure of internal PAS component deployments. Partners may also look to use BPM in their own BOSH releases. ODB SDK Recreate All Services Instances Errand \u00b6 When an OpsManager root CA is rotated and new non-configurable certificates generated, OpsManager can force a recreate of BOSH VMs so that they will contain the new root CA. However, it has no knowledge of VMs created by On-Demand Brokers. In order to allow recreate these Service Instance VMs behind On-Demand Brokers, it was decided that we would provide a new errand called Recreate All Service Instances on the ODB release. That errand would re-create all the VMs created by ODB in order to force the CA certificate rotation. PKS 1.4 New Features \u00b6 We are targeting PKS 1.4 for a mid-April release. Date TBD pending when two of the three major IaaSs release their K8s 1.13 compatible version. Kubernetes 1.13 \u00b6 PKS 1.4 will support K8s 1.13. Known changes in K8s 1.13 can be found here: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.13.md PKS 1.4 planned to be the first PKS version where you can run PKS and PAS in the same OM \u00b6 This is currently not a supported configuration but will be with the release of PKS 1.4. Windows Worker Support (Beta) \u00b6 PKS 1.4 intends to add Windows workers support as a beta feature. This will allow PKS workloads to be deployed on Windows. This is subject to change until the release date. PKS 1.4 will be compatible with Ops Manager 2.5. PCF 2.4 Compatibility Reminder \u00b6 Credhub 2.0 (Applications) \u00b6 Credhub 2.0 has backwards-incompatible API and manifest changes. The biggest changes are: Authorization model changes: Identities will no longer be able to write to CredHub solely by virtue of authenticating. Instead, an explicit access control entry will need to be created, granting an identity read, write, delete, read_acl, and/or write_acl permissions to an identity, for a given namespace. set and generate changes: CredHub is simplifying the rules that determine when set or generate requests will do nothing or overwrite existing values. Minor manifest changes: The structure of our properties hash is changing slightly. Authorization on by default: The default value of credhub.authorization.acls.enabled is changing from false to true. For tiles that are already consuming CredHub 1.9.x, there will not be any breaking changes. If you use CredHub, please perform regression testing with PAS for Credhub 2.0. We can give you access to an environment with an alpha PAS release with the new credhub verison. Customers who do a fresh install of PAS will be impacted, and will need to apply new permissions when bootstrapping. The Credhub 2.0 upgrade does not affect customers who upgrade PAS. Migrate cflinuxfs2 apps over to cflinuxfs3 \u00b6 In PAS 2.4, cflinuxfs3 will be the default stack underneath cf push ed applications. If your tile contains errands that push applications (e.g. Tile Generator app or app-broker packages, other service brokers), you must update to explicitly push apps with cflinuxfs3. Tile Generator updates to enable cflinuxfs3 will come in November. The stack property on apps is sticky, so it will not change automatically unless they are explicitly re-pushed with cflinuxfs3. Canonical will end general support for cflinuxfs2 stack (derived from Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 LTS) on April 18th, 2019. Because of this, we plan to remove cflinuxfs2 in a patch release of PCF 2.4. PCF 2.4 will not support cf-mysql or MySQLv1 \u00b6 PCF 2.4 will not support older versions of MySQL (cf-mysql and MySQL for PCF v1). For existing v1 users, v1 will be supported through October 2018. Xenial Stemcells \u00b6 Canonical will end support for Ubuntu Trusty Tahr on April 30th, 2019 and security fixes will no longer be backported. PCF is transitioning to use stemcells based on Xenial Xerus and will no longer support Trusty stemcells in PCF 2.5. Tile authors should start testing with the Xenial stemcells and fix any compatibility issues. Consul Removal / BOSH DNS Adoption \u00b6 For tiles that include consul clients: by the time a customer upgrades to PCF 2.4, you must have removed consul clients from your product, because the server will be completely gone and your deployments will fail to deploy. If your product needs to support multiple versions of PCF : you need to conditionally turn consul on/off in the 2.2 version of your product, as the manifest snippet below shows. Then you need to remove consul clients in the 2.3 version of your product, once you can count on BOSH DNS. - name: consul_agent release: consul consumes: | consul_common: {from: consul_common_link, deployment: \"(( ..cf.deployment_name ))\"} consul_client: {from: consul_client_link, deployment: \"(( ..cf.deployment_name ))\"} consul_server: nil manifest: | --- consul: client: enabled: \"(( $ops_manager.dns_enabled ? false : true ))\" PCF 2.3 Compatibility Reminder \u00b6 BOSH DNS Adoption (Consul Server Removed) \u00b6 In PCF 2.3, Consul server will be removed and BOSH DNS will be used instead. Tile authors should start the process of removing Consul agents , which needs to be completed by PCF 2.4. Consul will be completely removed by PCF 2.5. Credhub (Service Broker / Bosh Releases) \u00b6 Credhub 2.0 will be available for PCF 2.3 and may affect partner tiles in three areas: Ops Manager will act as the CredHub client, and the tile can continue to use the \\ ((( VARIABLE ))) syntax for templating. This should not affect most tile authors. If your tile includes a service broker that uses the secure credentials workflow , that service broker would act as a CredHub client and will need updating. Likewise, if a tile includes an app that uses this workflow, that app would act as a CredHub client and will need updating. If your tile includes its own CredHub instance, this not affected by this upgrade. Your tile manages is own CredHub version and should be upgraded separately Questions? \u00b6 Reach out to us on the Pivotal Partner Slack Team Forward Looking Statement.

PAS releases 2.3 will move to End of General Support (EOGS) with this release. PCF 2.6 Changes \u00b6 New GA Features \u00b6 Ops Manager \u00b6 [New Feature] : BPM support in bosh, available in this Ops Manager. [New Feature] : Drain Lifecycle updates to help improve deployment orchestration. [New Feature] : Operators using a Service Broker (SB) should be able to see the SB logs in OM\u2019s syslog via runtime config. [New Feature] : Ops Manager API users can now call an endpoint to receive a list of required fields for product configuration. [New Feature]: Multiple stemcells per tile is now possible, however, Tile Generator does not yet support this. PAS \u00b6 Beta Features \u00b6 App Developers can easily rollback to an app revision from a specific point in time. Operators can now obtain additional IAAS VM metrics via the Loggregator Firehose. App Operators can set up more than 10k syslog drains. Sidecar support for Diego Cell based applications. See CF Blog . ODB SDK Changes \u00b6 The latest version of the ODB SDK (v0.29.1) has been released. ODB SDK Recreate All Services Instances Errand \u00b6 When an Ops Manager root CA is rotated and new non-configurable certificates are generated, OpsManager can force a recreate of BOSH VMs so that they will contain the new root CA. However, it has no knowledge of VMs created by On-Demand Brokers. In order to recreate these Service Instance VMs behind On-Demand Brokers, it was decided that we would provide a new errand called Recreate All Service Instances on the ODB release. That errand would re-create all the VMs created by ODB in order to force the CA certificate rotation. If you are running on an older release of the ODB SDK, please upgrade to the latest release to take advantage of these features. Upcoming Deprecations \u00b6 Upgrade Spring Boot 1.0 App Brokers to Spring Boot 2.0 {#upgrade-spring-boot-1-0-app-brokers-to-spring-boot-2-0} \u00b6 Spring Boot 1.0 EOL is coming August 1, 2019 . Any apps or app brokers should be updated to Spring Boot 2.0 to stay current with security patches and general support by the Spring Team. Metron Agent Eventually Going Away \u00b6 The loggregator-agent release is the new drop-in replacement to replace metron. In PAS 2.5, metron agent will disappear and you will have to update your BOSH manifest to use the loggregator-agent release instead. Use UAA Client Credentials Instead of Admin Users \u00b6 The introduction of cf auth --client-credentials allows components using cloud_controller.admin to leverage a client instead of a user. PCF 2.5 will include a set of tile_installer_client credentials to bootstrap client credentials for long-term use, instead of using shared admin-level credentials. The benefits of this include supporting customers who need to use two-factor authentication for users, disabling internal users to meet compliance regulations, and better support for credential rotation. As the details of this develop, we plan to enhance Tile Generator to help make this process smoother. In the meantime, if you would like more information, please reach out to us in Pivotal Partners Slack. PKS 1.5 Changes \u00b6 PKS is scheduled for release in July 2019.

Beta Features \u00b6 Ops Manager \u00b6 Operators using a Service Broker can see the Service Broker syslogs in Ops Manager. Upcoming Deprecations \u00b6 BOSH is removing support for v1 manifests ( BREAKING CHANGE ) v1 manifests will stop working in BOSH DIR v270.0.0 and this will be a breaking change for anyone still using v1 manifest. We do not expect this to affect most tiles as Ops Manager is responsible for BOSH manifest generation. Replace uaa.port with uaa.ssl.port ( BREAKING CHANGE ) UAA is disallowing incoming HTTP traffic from UAA to the OM, PAS, and PKS databases. UAA now only supports HTTPS and platform component teams will need to use uaa.ssl.port. Deprecating the firehose Log Cache is replacing the firehose for logs, in the PCF 2.7 timeframe, the firehose should be considered deprecated. See the notice below for details. Remove ETCD and Consul: Final mile to remove consul from all tiles Final clean up for all teams to remove consul to remove tech debt and complexity from the platform Notice for Partners with Nozzles \u00b6 The v1 nozzle endpoint is being deprecated in December. v1 nozzles will not work after this date. This change will likely arrive in PCF version 2.8, which will likely be released in December 2019. You may already be using the v2 API, we\u2019re communicating this broadly to ensure that no partners are missed. To help with this transition, our team has built v2 API examples in the GitHub repository firehose-nozzle-v2 . There are two ways of connecting: the Reverse Log Proxy (RLP) and the Reverse Log Proxy Gateway (RLP Gateway). We recommend using the Gateway, as the deployment and authentication model is simpler (a BOSH release isn\u2019t required and the nozzle can be deployed as an app when using the RLP Gateway). The above repository contains code samples for both methods, but only packages the Gateway based solution into a tile. Reverse Log Proxy Gateway support was added in PCF 2.4. Pivotal support policies (n-2 release) should allow this support to be widespread by the September release of PCF 2.7. The payload will be slightly different, so translation into your system of record will require code changes. The loggregator API documentation describes a mapping between the v1 and v2 payload. If you\u2019re unsure what version of the API you\u2019re consuming, check the Golang dependencies. Using noaa and sonde-go indicates is the v1 API. The v2 API uses either go-loggregator or, for a Gateway based solution, potentially no Cloud Foundry specific libraries. The firehose-to-syslog project is a more complex, real-world example that was migrated from v1 to v2 via this pull request . Migrating to v2 does carry additional advantages: V2 moves away from WebSockets for communication, which caused issues with load balancers. V2 adds the ability to filter messages at source, which can greatly reduce the amount of data ingested. The model is no longer accept everything and discard. V2 reduces messages loss.

Prerequisites \u00b6 It is important to become familiar with the BOSH CLI and using SSH to connect to the Ops Manager VM and authenticate with the BOSH Director. Instructions on that can be found in Advanced Troubleshooting with BOSH . Commonly Reported Issues and Troubleshooting Suggestions \u00b6 Issue: Ops Manager reports install failed after hitting Apply Changes. (AKA \"Exit code -1\" Error) \u00b6 Suggestion 1: There is a more meaningful error hiding in there! Further error logs can be found by ssh-ing into the Ops Manager VM (Instructions: Advanced Troubleshooting with BOSH) and view the Ops Manager logs: less /var/log/opsmanager/production.log Suggestion 2: SSH to Ops Manager VM (Instructions: Advanced Troubleshooting with BOSH) and run command bosh tasks --recent , look for the relevant (probably failed) task. Run command bosh tasks <id> --debug for verbose logs. Issue: BOSH Errand in my deployment fails, and then deletes the VM where Errand is run, so I'm having trouble troubleshooting or look into logs. \u00b6 Error: Errand <errand-name> completed with error (exit code 1) Suggestion: Run the errand manually and use the --keep-alive flag. From the Ops Manager VM, run bosh -d <deployment-id> run-errand <errand-name> --keep-alive . Then you can use the bosh CLI to bosh ssh into the Errand VM and view logs in /var/vcap/sys/log . View the BOSH documentation on BOSH SSH and BOSH Errands for more info. Issue: BOSH Deployment fails because there is a problem in one of your job start or pre-start scripts. \u00b6 Error: Error: <job name> is not running after update. review logs for failed jobs: <job name> Error: Action Failed get_task: Task <id> result: 2 of 3 pre-start scripts failed.
